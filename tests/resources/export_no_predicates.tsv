OBI:0100046	phosphate buffered saline solution	PMID: 16279733.Dent Mater J. 2005 Sep;24(3):414-21.PBS buffer solutions with different pH values can change porosity of DNA-chitosan complexes.	IAO:0000122	Phosphate buffered saline (abbreviated PBS) is a buffer solution commonly used in biochemistry. It is a salty solution containing sodium chloride, sodium phosphate and in some preparations potassium chloride and potassium phosphate. The buffer helps to maintain a constant pH. The concentration usually matches the human body (isotonic).
